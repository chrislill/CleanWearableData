# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
## Introduction
This script produces a summary of the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset. It calculates the mean and standard deviation values for 33 different variables derived from this data, averaging them for each activity and each subject. 

It is a submission for a getting and cleaning data course project on Coursera. 

The original dataset is described in the following publication:
Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Dec 2012

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.

See 'CodeBook.md' for more details.
